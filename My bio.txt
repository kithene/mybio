My name is Peter Wilson.
I was born and raised in Kenya on the shows of Lake Victoria.
I love to travel, and to meet new people. I also love to bike ride.
Some times when I am free I volunteer in my community to help in any way I can.
I do not have any pets, if I get a pet I would preffer a dog.
Thank you for reading my bio.
